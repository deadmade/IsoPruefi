## Description:

Our project is designed to test the effectiveness of building insulation. To do this, it compares the interior and
exterior temperature data. On the inside, temperature data is collected from the north and south sides of the building.
The solution should be designed in such a way that data can be reliably recorded, transmitted and evaluated even in the
event of partial failures.

## Hardware:

2 Arduinos with one temperature sensor each, RTC modules and SD card modules
