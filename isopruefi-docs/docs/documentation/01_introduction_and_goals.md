# Introduction and Goals {#section-introduction-and-goals}

## Aim of our project IsoPrÃ¼fi:

Our project aims to test the effectiveness of building insulation based on outside temperature and present the data
clearly using diagrams.

---

## Features

### Must-Have

- A website for a user-friendly presentation of temperature comparison diagrams

- Reliable sensors that measure interior temperature

- The ability to retrieve outside temperature data

- Clusterization of containers that we create ourselves

### Should-Have

- Sensors should be capable of storing temperature data for a period of one day, even in the absence of an internet
  connection or synchronization with the server

- A website should be used to offer configuration options

### Could-Have

- Database clustering

### Won't Have

- The containers will only run on one server, however they are designed to function independently of each other

- Since this is a software project, we won't implement any resilience on the hardware side

## Requirements Overview {#_requirements_overview}

### Functional Requirements

- The system must provide three data sources: two for indoor measurements and one for outdoor measurements
- Data should be updated every 60 seconds
- Each data point must include both temperature and timestamp
- Users must be able to view diagrams and evaluations of the collected data
- Users should have access to historical data to observe long-term trends
- The system must use containers for deployment
- In case of no network and or MQTT broker connection, the temperature data will be saved on an SD card for up to 24 h

### Non-Functional Requirements

- The system should achieve an availability of 99.5%
- The system must remain reliable even if one container fails
- Data must be persistently stored in the database
- Automated unit tests must cover core functionalities, including correct data transmission, successful data storage, and simulation of failure scenarios

## Quality Goals {#_quality_goals}

| Quality Goal   | Description                                                                                            |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Persistence    | Sensor readings must be logged centrally (database) and  locally (SD card), if offline -> No data loss |
| Data Integrity | Data must include timestamps and sequance to prevent corruption or duplication                         |
| Availability   | The system must remain partially operational during network outages and recover automatically          |
