# MVP (Minimum Viable Product):

## Aim of our project:

Our project aims to test the effectiveness of building insulation based on outside temperature and present the data clearly using diagrams.

## Features:
### Must-Have:

- A website for a user-friendly presentation of temperature comparison diagrams

- Reliable sensors that measure interior temperature

- The ability to retrieve outside temperature data

- Clusterization of containers that we create ourselves

### Should-Have:
- Sensors should be capable of storing temperature data for a period of one day, even in the absence of an internet connection or synchronization with the server

- A website should be used to offer configuration options

### Could-Have:
- Database clustering

### Won't Have:
- The containers will only run on one server, however they are designed to function independently of each other

- Since this is a software project, we won't implement any resilience on the hardware side
