# MVP (Minimum Viable Product):

## Aim of our project:

Our project aims to test the effectiveness of building insulation based on outside temperature and present the data clearly using diagrams.

## Features:
### Must-Have:

- A website for a user-friendly presentation of temperature comparison diagrams

- Reliable sensors that measure interior temperature

- The ability to retrieve external temperature data

- Clusterization of containers that we create ourselves

### Should-Have:
- The sensors should be capable of storing temperature data for a period of one day, even in the absence of an internet connection or synchronization with the server.

- A website should be used to offer configuration options.

### Could-Have:
- Database clustering

### Won't Have:
- The containers we create ourselfs will be designed to function independently of each other. In practice, however, the containers will only run on one server.

- Since this is a software project, we won't implement any resilience on the hardware side, besides the hardware modules on our sensors.
